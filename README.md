# HW.Exception
During the lesson, we worked on 2 tasks to practice Exception handling:
1. The racing application with the addition of exceptions: A method called "Pass Diagnostic" has been added to the Car class. This method has been overridden for the "Passenger Cars" and "Trucks" classes - objects of these types can undergo diagnostics. Objects of the "Buses" class cannot undergo diagnostics. An exception has been added: if the driver does not specify a driver's license type or if the format of the driver's license is incorrect, the application should throw the message "Driver's license type must be specified!". A program has been written to check that all objects of all classes have passed diagnostics. If an object of the "Buses" class is being checked, the application should display the message "Bus ... ... ... does not require diagnostics," and this will not be considered an error. If an object of the "Passenger Cars" or "Trucks" class fails diagnostics, the program should throw an error.
2. The program checks the correctness of entered login and password data. A static method has been created that takes three parameters: login, password, and confirmPassword. Input requirements are as follows: The login contains only Latin letters, digits, and underscores. The length of the login can be from 1 to 20 characters. If the login is not specified, is longer than the specified limit, or contains other characters, the program should throw a WrongLoginException. The password contains only Latin letters, digits, and underscores. The length of the password can be from 1 to 20 characters. Password and confirmPassword must be equal. If the password is not specified, is longer than the specified limit, contains other characters, or if password and confirmPassword are not equal, the program should throw a WrongPasswordException. WrongPasswordException and WrongLoginException are custom exception classes with two constructors: one default constructor and the other accepting an exception message and passing it to the Exception class constructor.
